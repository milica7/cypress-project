# Running the Front-end

You can run the React front-end with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

We recommend using Node.js `16.3.0` to avoid any issues with building native
dependencies, but you will likely be fine with the latest LTS version too.

Follow these steps to install dependencies with npm and start the front-end
development server.

```
$ cd yams
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Your default browser should open a new window at `http://localhost:3000`, and
you should see the yams app UI.
